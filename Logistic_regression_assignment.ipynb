        "\n",
        "1. Softmax Regression\n",

        "Pros:\n",

        "When to use Softmax:\n",

        "When you have multiple classes (3 or more) and want to model them directly in a single classifier.\n",
        "When probabilities for each class are important and you want the sum of probabilities to equal 1.\n",
        "When the classes are not heavily imbalanced, or the model is robust enough to handle class imbalance.\n",
        "When your dataset is large enough to allow for the direct modeling of all classes together.\n",
        "2. One-vs-Rest (OvR)\n",
        "How it works: One-vs-Rest (OvR) is an approach where multiple binary classifiers are trained, one for each class. For each class, the classifier is trained to distinguish that class from all the others. During prediction, each classifier outputs a probability, and the class with the highest probability across all classifiers is chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pros:\n",

        "Flexibility: OvR allows you to use binary classifiers (like logistic regression) for each class, and you can use any model that works well for binary classification.\n",

        "Multiple classifiers: OvR requires training multiple binary classifiers, which can increase computational complexity and memory requirements, especially when there are many classes.\n",
        "No coherent probability distribution: Each classifier outputs a separate probability, so the probabilities do not necessarily sum to 1. This can make interpreting the results as a probability distribution more challenging.\n",
        "Potential for conflicting predictions: Since each classifier is independent, there is a possibility that more than one classifier could predict the same class as the most likely, leading to conflicts in predictions.\n",
        "When to use One-vs-Rest (OvR):\n",
        "\n",
        "When you need to use binary classifiers that work well for each individual class (e.g., logistic regression, SVM).\n",

        "When the number of classes is large, and you prefer a more modular approach, where each binary classifier handles a specific class.\n",
